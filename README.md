## IoT-Driven Speech Capture and Distilled Knowledge Generation

### Introduction:
This project presents an IoT-based system for recording speech, generating accurate transcripts, and extracting key points. By utilizing hardware components such as a microphone, a recording control button, a speaker, and a Raspberry Pi for computation, the system offers a user-friendly and efficient solution. It incorporates an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) module for speech-to-text conversion and utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to extract essential key points. The system generates a transcript file and a key points summary file, providing comprehensive and concise information. Through evaluations, the project demonstrates accurate transcription, effective key points extraction, and optimal processing time, highlighting its potential for speech processing applications.

### Purpose:
The primary purpose of the project is to assist teachers or speakers in creating comprehensive session notes that can be shared with their students or audience. By providing accurate speech recording, automated transcription, and key points extraction, the project aims to simplify the process of summarising important information from the recorded sessions. The system aims to save time and effort for teachers and speakers by generating organised and concise notes that can be easily distributed, facilitating effective communication and knowledge sharing.

#### Additional Purposes:
1. Enhancing Accessibility: The project aims to improve accessibility by providing text- based transcripts of recorded speech sessions. This enables individuals with hearing impairments or language barriers to access the content and benefit from the information presented.
2. Supporting Learning and Review: The generated transcripts and key points summaries serve as valuable resources for students and learners to review and reinforce their understanding of the session's content. It allows for convenient reference and revision, enhancing the learning experience.
3. Promoting Efficient Information Retrieval: By extracting key points from the recorded sessions, the project helps in condensing the content and facilitating quick information retrieval. This is particularly useful for busy professionals or individuals who need to access specific details from the sessions without going through the entire recording.
4. Facilitating Knowledge Sharing: The project aims to enable seamless sharing of session notes with students or the wider audience. The generated transcripts and key points summaries can be easily disseminated through various digital platforms, fostering effective knowledge transfer and collaboration.

### Expected Outcomes:
1. A fully functional IoT-based speech recording and transcription system.
2. Accurate transcription of recorded speech into text.
3. Extraction of key points from the speech content, providing concise summaries.
4. Generation of two output files - a transcript file and a key points summary file.
5. Evaluation metrics, including transcription accuracy, key points extraction quality, and processing time.

### Conclusion:
The IoT-Based Speech Recording and Transcription System with Key Points Summary project aims to develop a practical and efficient solution for recording and analysing speech data. By integrating IoT technologies and leveraging advanced techniques like ASR and NLP, this project addresses the need for accurate transcription and key points extraction. The successful implementation of this project will provide a valuable tool for various applications, including meetings, lectures, and interviews, enabling users to obtain comprehensive transcripts and concise summaries of recorded speech sessions.
